# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

// including the input partitions you have designed

# 3 Test cases developed

Methods to be tested in org.jfree.data.Range: 
contains(double value)
toString()
getCentralValue()   

Methods to be tested in org.jfree.data.DataUtilities: 
calculateRowTotal()
calculateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column)


// write down the name of the test methods and classes. Organize the based on
the source code method // they test. identify which tests cover which partitions
you have explained in the test strategy section //above

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed
